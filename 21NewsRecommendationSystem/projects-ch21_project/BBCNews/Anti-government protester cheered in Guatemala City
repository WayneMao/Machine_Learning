He got blisters on his feet and said he lost more than 4kg (9lbs) in weight.In the capital, he called on all Guatemalans to rise against impunity and allegedly corrupt politicians who have enriched themselves with public money.President Perez Molina, who has the backing of the army, says he has done nothing wrong and will not leave office before his term expires next January.
