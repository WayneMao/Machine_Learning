Airline Blue Islands selling off Trislander aircraft
Channel Islands airline Blue Islands is selling off its Trislander aircraft.The two 14-seat, single-pilot operated planes would no longer be part of the fleet from 4 December, it said.The decision is a result of customers preferring its two ATR and five Jetstream aircraft, which are quieter and more spacious, Blue Islands said.Four pilots will be affected by the change and it is hoped alternative jobs will be found for them within the business, the Guernsey company added.
