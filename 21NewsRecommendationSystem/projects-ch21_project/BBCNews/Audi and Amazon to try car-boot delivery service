Audi and Amazon to try car-boot delivery service
Packages could soon be delivered to the boot of your Audi as part of a trial involving the car maker, Amazon and DHL.Kicked off by Audi, the system aims to end the frustration of missing the arrival of a package being delivered to home or work.Instead, Audi owners will be able to use their car as a shipping address for items ordered online.A pilot project to test the system is planned to take place in May in Munich.Using Audi's in-car communications system, Connect, DHL delivery drivers would track a customer's vehicle over a specified period of time and then use a digital access code to unlock the boot, the car maker said. This code would then expire as soon as the boot was shut.The deliveries will be available only to customers signed up for online retail service Amazon Prime.In March, the Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees US airspace, gave Amazon permission to carry out tests using unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, for its planned PrimeAir service.
