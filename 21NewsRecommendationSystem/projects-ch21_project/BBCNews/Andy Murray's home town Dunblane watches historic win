Andy Murray's home town Dunblane watches historic win
The home town of grand slam champion Andy Murray was in ecstatic mood after his win at the US Open.Thousands in Dunblane, near Stirling, stayed up into the early hours to watch the 25-year-old bag the historic victory.Murray beat Serbia's Novak Djokovic in a thrilling five-set match.At the Dunblane Hotel almost 100 people erupted into mass celebration and chanted "There's only one Andy Murray" when the final ball was hit.Murray has become the first Scot to win a grand slam and the first British man to win such a title since 1936.He had appeared in four other grand slam finals - losing them all.The tennis ace triumphed in the New York Flushing Meadows stadium fresh from winning a gold medal at the London Olympics.The win brought congratulations from First Minister Alex Salmond and Prime Minister David Cameron.The US final, which lasted just under five hours, was much anticipated by Dunblane.At the Dunblane Hotel, tennis fan Gavin Noland, 63, said: "Andy is Dunblane's hero, not just Dunblane, the whole of Scotland and the rest of Britain."He was magnificent. I've been following him from the very beginning.ByAndrew BlackBBC Scotland news"Dunblane Sports Club is where it all began for Andy Murray - he started playing tennis here as a young boy and despite his international success it's said his heart still lies here."As news of Andy's victory spread throughout his home town of Dunblane this morning, local school children braved the cold morning to come to the sports club to play tennis. Many of them also spoke of being inspired by the tennis ace to improve their game and perhaps even emulate his success."Andy Murray has brought every trophy he has ever won back to Dunblane Sports Club to show aspiring tennis players. In his absence, coaches at the sports club placed a large cardboard cut out of Andy on the open air tennis courts."In the build-up to the match, someone put up a banner at the side of the tennis court declaring 'good luck Andy' later that was replaced with another banner stating 'well done Andy'.""I think he's coming into his game, just since winning the Olympics he's taken off like a meteorite."Another supporter Dave Whitton, 62, said: "I'm just so happy for Andy - no tears this time, just complete joy and happiness, which is not only just for him but for the people of Dunblane and the whole of Scotland."Referring to the Dunblane massacre in 1996, when gunman Thomas Hamilton shot dead 16 primary school children and their teacher, Mr Whitton said: "It's a town where, as you'll probably know, things have happened. But this brings a moment of joy and happiness instead of other things that have happened."We share in his happiness today emotionally."Like a true Scotsman we always live in hope whether it's football or tennis. I've followed all his games as has my daughter who lives in London, we've been texting each other all night and I'm sure she'll have a tear in her eye."The supporters were with Murray all the way, celebrating and commiserating every point won and lost.The bar kept its doors open late to allow the patrons to see the end of the game, and dished out popcorn and hot dogs.Graham Neeson, 53, from Glasgow, was visiting a friend in Perth and started watching the game there before leaving to get the last train home.However, he hopped off at Dunblane, to make sure he could see "history in the making".He said: "I wouldn't have got home in time to watch the whole thing so I thought, where better to jump off than the epicentre of Murrayland - Dunblane."I'll need to stay overnight at the hotel now and get the morning train, but it's been worth it. I couldn't miss history in the making."I had him down as favourite to win before the final even started. I'm really over the moon for him and there's such a good atmosphere about the town."Following Murray's win, Mr Salmond said it was "fantastic".He went on: "This is another brilliant win over Novak Djokovic and continues an amazing year for Andy. Now Olympic and US Open champion, Andy truly is a Scottish sporting legend and I'm certain that more grand slam titles will follow."
