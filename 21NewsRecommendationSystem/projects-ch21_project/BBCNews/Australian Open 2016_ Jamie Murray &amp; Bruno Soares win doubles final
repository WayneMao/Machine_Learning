Media playback is not supported on this deviceJamie Murray became the first Briton to win the Australian Open men's doubles title in 82 years, as he and Bruno Soares beat Daniel Nestor and Radek Stepanek 2-6 6-4 7-5.Brazil's Soares, 33, twice lost his serve as Canada's Nestor, 43, and Czech Stepanek, 37, took the opening set.Murray, 29, and Soares began to exert more pressure and broke in the fifth game on the way to the second set.The pair then served out for the win at the second attempt in the decider.Murray was serving for victory at 5-4 up in the third, but failed to hold serve as he was broken for the first time in the match as Nestor and Stepanek gave themselves hope.But Murray and Soares immediately broke back before the latter comfortably held on to his serve to complete victory.The livewire Murray's volleying and serving were a major part of the success, as the Scot -whose brother Andy plays in the men's singles final on Sunday- added the title to his mixed doubles win with Jelena Jankovic at Wimbledon in 2007.Andy Murray turned up for the post-match trophy ceremony and an emotional Jamie said: "Andy, you should be in bed, not here taking photos."Having reached the Wimbledon and US Open finals with John Peers in 2015, Jamie Murray joined up with Soares in an attempt to go one better.However, it seemed the duo's first major together would end with a similar fate as Nestor and Stepanek eased in front in 38 minutes.Soares held for the first time in the match as he and Murray drew level at 2-2 in second set.The Brazilian started to raise his game to that of his team-mate and the pair, on Nestor's serve, finally took a break point at the eighth attempt to take a 3-2 lead before levelling the match.In the third set, the momentum was with Murray and Soares as the former became the first Briton to win the men's doubles title at the Australian Open since Fred Perry and Pat Hughes in 1934."You dream about this moment since when you start playing tennis and I don't know what to say," said Soares."Jamie, my partner, it's only one month [since we teamed up], but I think we can retire now."Thanks for inviting me and thanks for playing such good tennis. I hope we can carry it on and play for many more matches like this."
