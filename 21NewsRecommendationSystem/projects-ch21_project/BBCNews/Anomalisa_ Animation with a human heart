Anomalisa: Animation with a human heart
It's a tale of a world-weary, middle-aged man struggling to find meaning in his existence  - and then he meets a woman, Lisa, who may or may not change his life.The anomaly about Anomalisa, however, written and co-directed by four-time Oscar nominee Charlie Kaufman, is that it's a stop-motion animation - "an animation truly intended only for adults", he says.The New York-born screenwriter, who won an Academy Award for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind in 2004 and is also the writer of 2002's Adaptation and Being John Malkovich, first created Anomalisa as a radio play more than a decade ago.British actor David Thewlis and Jennifer Jason Leigh, recently the star of Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight, took the parts of Michael Stone, a self-help speaker who is suffering within, and Lisa, a socially awkward sales rep, who meet at a conference.Kaufman says he didn't really know who David Thewlis was 10 years ago, adding:  "I just liked his work, and the same for Jennifer Jason Leigh."I wrote David a note asking him if he'd come over to the States and do this sound-only play for me and he did. I couldn't imagine casting any other voices for the movie either."Anomalisa was first performed in 2005, but Leigh says she "was in love with Lisa from the very first minute"."When we did the plays, I was so sad when it was over, it felt like an all-too-brief moment. The film treatment was proposed quite soon afterwards though, so I suppose she's stayed with me all these years."It's quite a challenge for an actor - it's sound only, no interaction between us, even when we were standing on stage reading the script for the play."But an animation feels like precisely the right treatment because the focus of the film really is on voices - how difficult it is to hear a different one in a crowd, one that means anything to us."Anomalisa is co-directed by Kaufman and TV producer Duke Johnson, but it was eventually brought to life by funding from Kickstarter. Kaufman describes being surprised and relieved to get the money to make the film."We've been working on it for three years under the radar, with very few people knowing about it and it was a struggle," he says."We didn't know whether we'd get any positive reaction at all."At its debut at the Venice and Telluride film festivals last year, Anomalisa was described by Rolling Stone magazine as a "masterpiece", while Empireclaimed"it has more heart and soul… than 99.9% of live action movies."The Guardian alsopredicted: "Kaufman and co-director Duke Johnson offer images so moving and yet also so filthy, Anomalisa might just make the first R-rated best animation Oscar winner"- a reference to the sexually explicit scenes in the film.The film was nominated in the best animation film category at this year's Oscars, but the statuette itself went to Pixar's Inside Out.Kaufman maintains he's glad he took the risk of making an animation, saying what he calls "the central conceit of the film - the lack of ability to make connections with other humans that Michael Stone struggles with - would be difficult to accomplish with live action."The emotional connection audiences are having to Anomalisa is unique to the animation," he continues. "It seems to have this special power that people are reacting to."I'm told that with non-human actors you can identify more with the characters as you're not blinded by who the actors are in real life. It allows you to be immersed in them.""You identify in a deeper way, although I keep forgetting that they are puppets," says Leigh."Also, I think the themes of the film - how hard it is to make a connection, to hear a unique voice in a crowd - I think everyone can relate to it."The screenplay is set right before texting became normal, and I used to spend a lot of time... on the phone to my friends. Hearing voices was the way we connected."Who bothers with calling someone now? How often do we really hear someone's voice speaking into our life? I think we yearn for it."Much of Charlie Kaufman's work - from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind to Synecdoche, New York, his 2008 directorial debut - features male protagonists enduring internal suffering, but under darkly funny circumstances. Anomalisa continues in that vein."If you're a writer, you are always looking in the mirror. You are always trying to be honest about what worries you, what frustrates you," says Kaufman."I have to use my personal feelings or else it's just not going to work. So there are always elements of me in my films."I think what's the relief about this though is that even though Michael Stone is a middle-aged man, I've had 20-year-olds coming up to me and saying how much they related to him."I think the lack of ability we have to form meaningful connections is the struggle of the human soul at any age."Anomalisa is out in the UK and Ireland on 11 March.
