A-lister Naomi Watts links up with Anglesey football club
A Hollywood A-lister has agreed to become the honorary president of a small Anglesey football club.Naomi Watts said she was "very excited" to take on the role for Glantraeth FC, based in Malltraeth, which has a population of 400 people.The English-born star of Mulholland Drive and King Kong spent time as a child on her grandparents' farm nearby.Glantraeth FC play in the third tier Welsh Alliance football league division one and get crowds of 40 people.After former president Sir George Meyrick stood down last August, secretary Stan Strickland suggested Ms Watts as a replacement.He sent a letter to her agent who is based on Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, and received a positive response on Monday night.Mr Strickland said: "She spent three years of her childhood here and attended school in Llangefni before becoming a major film star."I just thought 'if you don't ask, you don't get'."She has now got her publicist involved, so we could end up in the New York Times."Mr Strickland is expecting further correspondence with Ms Watts about her involvement over the coming days, but said her name will appear on the website, letterheads and match day programmes, while she will be provided with annual performance updates.
