Alex McLeish to leave Racing Genk at end of season
Former Scotland and Rangers manager Alex McLeish is to leave Belgian club Racing Genk after one campaign.The 56-year-old took over in August with Genk 13th in the 16-team table after four games.He steered them to within a point of the top six, failing to reach the play-offs for the league title."Communicating this decision creates clarity and will allow us now to put our focus on winning a Europa League place," said McLeish."Myself, the staff and players promise to give every ounce of energy as we did in the regular competition."McLeish, who managed Birmingham City, Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest after resigning as Scotland boss in 2007, signed a two-year contract on his arrival in Belgium.The teams ranked seven to 14 in the Jupiler Pro League split into two play-off groups, with the winners of each section meeting over two legs.The winners of that tie go on to meet either the fourth or fifth team from the top six, depending on where the cup winners finish, for the final Europa League spot.
