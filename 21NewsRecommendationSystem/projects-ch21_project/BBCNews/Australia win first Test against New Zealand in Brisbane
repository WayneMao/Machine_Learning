Australia win first Test against New Zealand in Brisbane
ScorecardAustralia took seven wickets before lunch on the final day to seal victory against New Zealand in the first Test of a three-match series.The Black Caps, having been set a world record 504 to win, resumed on 142-3 and their challenge quickly folded.Brendon McCullum hit a run-a-ball 80 but the Kiwis were all out for 295.Spinner Nathan Lyon took 3-63 in the second innings, while Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Marsh claimed two wickets apiece.Australia's first innings 556-4 declared set them up for the victory and opener David Warner was named man of the match for his scores of 163 and 116."I thought the first morning really set the tone for us with Joe Burns and Davy Warner batting so well," Australia captain Steve Smith said."I thought the top order set the test match up for us. The partnerships that we had in that top three were crucial to our success."The second Test begins in Perth on Friday and the series concludes with the inaugural day-night Test in Adelaide.New Zealand now face a tough task in extending their run of seven Test series without defeat.Black Caps captain McCullum hopes paceman Tim Southee recovers from a back injury to play in the next match."We've achieved some special things of late and it is going to take a special effort over the next couple of Tests to come out with the spoils," McCullum said.Both captains thought the game was played in a good spirit but Smith was disappointed at Starc throwing the ball at New Zealand tailender Mark Craig towards the end of the match when there was no run-out possible."It was just a bit of frustration and I think he just needs to let it out in other ways," Smith said."He's done it a few times before and I'm going to have a word to him when we get back to the sheds."
