Adam Johnson trial: Couple split after 'cheating' admission
The ex-girlfriend of former England footballer Adam Johnson has told a jury they split up after he admitted cheating on her with "quite a few" women.Giving evidence for the ex-Sunderland winger at Bradford Crown Court, Stacey Flounders said she did not see a future in their relationship.The 26-year-old is the mother of Mr Johnson's one-year-old daughter.Mr Johnson, 28, denies two counts of sexual activity with a child.In the witness box, Miss Flounders described how he had told her "everything" about kissing a 15-year-old girl when he returned from a police station after his arrest in March last year.Asked if he talked about other things, she said: "The other women that he cheated on me with."Miss Flounders was asked by Orlando Pownall QC, defending, how many there were and she said: "Quite a few."When questioned about about the future of her relationship with Mr Johnson, she replied: "We're just going to remain friends."She told the jury she had stayed with him after his arrest "because he was honest with me and I knew he was telling the truth"."We'd just had a daughter. I wanted us to be a family. My head was all over the place. I didn't know what was going on."Mr Pownall finished his questions by asking Miss Flounders if she saw any future in "the relationship that you had".She replied: "Do you mean now? Not at the minute, I don't. No."She was asked about messages she exchanged with Mr Johnson on the day of the incident with the girl, and she admitted she suspected him of being unfaithful but had no "hard and fast evidence".She said he first told her he was going to plead guilty around September last year.Miss Flounders said she had previously exchanged messages with the teenager involved after she recognised her as one of the fans who waited for Mr Johnson after home matches.She said she even wished the girl happy birthday in 2014.She added that after his arrest, Mr Johnson told her the girl was aged 16.Kate Blackwell, QC, prosecuting, went through some of the details of the teenager's account of the incident and asked Miss Flounders whether her partner had told her about each.Miss Blackwell asked her if he told her the pair had kissed with tongues and about various messages Mr Johnson had exchanged with the girl.Miss Flounders agreed that he had not told her, although she said he had mentioned he asked for a "thank you kiss".Earlier, Miss Flounders was asked a series of questions about her partner's pubic hair and was asked to examine a photograph.The teenager involved in the incident has told the jury Mr Johnson was shaved in that area.Miss Flounders said he would trim the area with scissors, but would not shave.Mr Johnson began his football career at Middlesbrough before moving to Manchester City and then on to Sunderland in 2012.He has previously pleaded guilty to one count of sexual activity with a child and one charge of grooming.  These relate to him kissing the girl in his Range Rover after exchanging messages with her on social media.But he denies two further charges of sexual activity with a child relating to the same incident.
