Antigua and Barbuda country profile
Antigua and Barbuda is one of the Caribbean's most prosperous nations, thanks to its tourism industry and offshore financial services.But a reliance on tourism makes the nation vulnerable to downturns in the world market.Antigua has tangled with the United States over its online gambling industry, which at its height employed more than 4,000 people and was a major contributor to the economy. But it shrunk drastically because of US restrictions, the Antiguan government says.The Bird family has dominated the country's politics since its independence in 1981 until 1994. Underlying this stability was a succession of scandals, including allegations of corruption. The Bird family was also accused of abuse of authority.In 2009, the country's economy was rocked by news that its single biggest investor, Texan billionaire Allen Stanford, had been charged with massive fraud by the US authorities.Population90,800Area442 sq km (170 sq miles)Major languageEnglishMajor religionChristianityCurrencyEast Caribbean dollarHead of state: Queen Elizabeth II, represented by a governor-generalPrime minister: Gaston BrowneGaston Browne took over as prime minister when his Labour Party won the general elections in June 2014 after defeating the ruling United Progressive Party (UPP).Browne has served as a senior bank manager with the Swiss American Banking Group.Mr Browne pledged to transform the financially crippled twin island nation into an "economic powerhouse" by attracting investment.His vision is to transform Antigua and Barbuda into "a globally competitive, premier tourism and financial services economy, producing well-paying jobs and a higher standard of living for the people".The media sector as a whole offers diverse views, including criticism of the government.
