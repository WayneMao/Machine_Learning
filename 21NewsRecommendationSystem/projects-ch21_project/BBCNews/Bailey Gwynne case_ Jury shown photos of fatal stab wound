Bailey Gwynne case: Jury shown photos of fatal stab wound
The jury in the trial of a teenager accused of murdering a pupil at an Aberdeen school has been shown photos of the fatal stab wound.Bailey Gwynne, 16, died after being stabbed at Cults Academy last October.The 16-year-old accused, who cannot be named for legal reasons, denies murder.The jury at the High Court in Aberdeen was shown two post-mortem images on the fourth day of the trial. Pathologist James Grieve said the stab wound had gone into the heart.Asked if it was survivable, he said he was not surprised it had proved to be a fatal injury.Mr Grieve said he could not say the injury was not survivable, as it could theoretically have happened outside a cardiac surgical theatre with surgeons already "scrubbed up".But he said the further away you were from expert treatment, the less chance there was of survival.Mr Grieve said Cults Academy was where his own children went to school, and that it was not very far out of the city - but far enough.The Crown case has now concluded, and defence counsel Ian Duguid QC said the accused had elected not to give evidence.The trial has been adjourned until Monday at 09:30 when the closing Crown and defence speeches will be heard.The court heard on Thursday how the teenage accused sobbed as he was charged with murder and said: "I did try and save him."The jury watched a police interview where the accused said he had pulled out a knife to "scare him [Bailey] away" and that he later tried to take off Bailey's blazer to help stop the bleeding.He also said he carried a knife because he had never fitted in and was "trying to act cool".During a police interview the day after the incident, the accused was asked what had happened on 28 October.He told police Bailey had made a comment about someone getting fatter, and he [the accused] had replied "just like your mum".The accused said in the interview: "I saw he was quite angry."I pulled out the knife, opened it up and tried to scare him away with it."He said Bailey got in the way and was stabbed.The accused then told police Bailey threw a few punches before a teacher got involved.He said: "We stood up, I noticed the bleeding. I saw blood dripping from Bailey."The 16-year-old accused said Bailey then collapsed and he had shouted to the teacher.The accused said he tried to take Bailey's blazer off to stop the bleeding.The jury heard earlier how an argument between Bailey and the accused had begunin a row over some biscuitswhich led to name-calling and then a fight between Bailey and the accused.Witnesses said they were not aware of any conflict between the two before the incident.The murder charge against the 16-year-old claims he did "engage in fighting" with Bailey and struck him on the body with a knife.In addition, the accused is also alleged to have had knives or "bladed instruments" as well as two knuckledusters at the school "without reasonable excuse or lawful authority" on various occasions between 1 August 2013 and the day of the alleged murder.The trial, before judge Lady Stacey, continues.
