Action plan to cut lung disease in Wales
Sufferers of respiratory illnesses are being urged to take personal responsibility for their lifestyle choices in a bid to cut lung disease.It causes one in seven deaths in Wales and is the third largest killer for both women and men.The Welsh government has unveiled its five-year plan to tackle respiratory illnesses including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.It included raising awareness and ensuring "effective treatment".The Welsh government said people of all ages will be encouraged to be aware of the dangers of smoking.But it said where problems with lung health occurred, people could expect "early and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment so the quality of their life can be optimised".The plans are part of the government's five-year Together for Health strategy."To achieve the best possible outcomes for patients with a respiratory condition they need to be fully involved in their care," said Health Minister Mark Drakeford."Whether it is that of a child and their family managing a new diagnosis of asthma, or an elderly patient with a terminal diagnosis considering options for palliative care."Patient education and co-production of personalised care need to be part of the patient's care pathway."
