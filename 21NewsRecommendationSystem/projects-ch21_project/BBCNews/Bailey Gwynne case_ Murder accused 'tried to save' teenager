Bailey Gwynne case: Murder accused 'tried to save' teenager
A teenager accused of stabbing a pupil to death at an Aberdeen school sobbed as he was charged with murder and said: "I did try and save him."Bailey Gwynne, 16, died after being stabbed at Cults Academy last October.The 16-year-old accused, who cannot be named for legal reasons, denies murder.On the third day of the trial, the High Court in Aberdeen watched a police interview with the accused who was charged after telling police: "I didn't mean to, but I stabbed him."After being told he was being charged, the accused added: "I am being charged with murder?"Earlier in the interview, the accused said he had pulled out a knife to "scare him [Bailey] away" and that he later tried to take off Bailey's blazer to help stop the bleeding.He also said he carried a knife because he had never fitted in and was "trying to act cool".During a police interview the day after the incident, the accused was asked what had happened on 28 October.He told police Bailey had made a comment about someone getting fatter, and he [the accused] had replied "just like your mum".The accused said in the interview: "I saw he was quite angry."I pulled out the knife, opened it up and tried to scare him away with it."He said Bailey got in the way and was stabbed.The accused then told police Bailey threw a few punches before a teacher got involved.He said: "We stood up, I noticed the bleeding. I saw blood dripping from Bailey."The 16-year-old accused said Bailey then collapsed and he had shouted to the teacher.The accused said he tried to take Bailey's blazer off to stop the bleeding.He said: "Blood was spewing out."He continued: "I saw Bailey having convulsions. I was almost crying."The accused told police that shortly after that he had said "I know he's going to die, I know he's going to die".Asked why he had a knife, he told police he never fitted in.He said: "I was just trying to act cool, act tough."Earlier, the court heard that a laptop used by the accused contained an internet search for "how to get rid of someone annoying".Forensic computer analyst Charles Bruce told the High Court in Aberdeen that "difference between a homicide and a murder" was also searched.He said an internet address relating to a YouTube video of "14-year-old Bronx student stabs bully to death outside school" was also found.A joint minute of agreement on the third day of the trial stated that the laptop used by the accused was handed over to police by his father the day after Bailey's death.Under cross examination by defence counsel Ian Duguid QC, Mr Bruce said he did not know what results the searches brought up.Mr Duguid suggested the "how to get rid of someone annoying" search brought up a page about how to get rid of annoying friends - with responses such as "stop speaking".Mr Bruce said he had not seen the page.Mr Duguid asked: "No-one has followed through on these searches?"Mr Bruce said: "It appears so."The trial began on Tuesday, when the jury was told it was agreed by both prosecutors and defence lawyers that the accused became engaged in a fight with Bailey on 28 October 2015, that the victim was struck with a knife and suffered a "penetrating stab wound to the heart".The jury heard earlier how an argument between Bailey and the accused had begunin a row over some biscuitswhich led to name-calling and then a fight between Bailey and the accused.Witnesses said they were not aware of any conflict between the two before the incident.The murder charge against the 16-year-old claims he did "engage in fighting" with Bailey and struck him on the body with a knife.In addition, the accused is also alleged to have had knives or "bladed instruments" as well as two knuckledusters at school "without reasonable excuse or lawful authority" on various occasions between 1 August 2013 and the day of the alleged murder.The trial, before judge Lady Stacey, continues.
