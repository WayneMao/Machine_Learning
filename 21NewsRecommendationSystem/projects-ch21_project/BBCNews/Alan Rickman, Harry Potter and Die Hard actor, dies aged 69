The intransigence which made him the great artist he was - his ineffable and cynical wit, the clarity with which he saw most things, including me, and the fact that he never spared me the view. I learned a lot from him."She added: "He was, above all things, a rare and unique human being and we shall not see his like again."Announcing his death on Thursday, a family statement said: "The actor and director Alan Rickman has died from cancer at the age of 69.
