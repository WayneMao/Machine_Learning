Arvind Kejriwal sworn in as Delhi's chief minister
Arvind Kejriwal, the leader of a new anti-corruption party in India, has been sworn in as Delhi's chief minister at the city's Ramlila Ground.He has pledged to end the culture of privilege in Indian politics, and used public transport to reach the ceremony.Mr Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), or Common Man's party, won 28 of the 70 assembly seats and was able to form a government with Congress party support.The Congress party lost control of Delhi, winning only eight seats."This is a huge victory for the people of Delhi,'' said the former civil servant, to applause from tens of thousands gathered at the ground. "The people of Delhi have shown that elections can be fought and won with honesty."Earlier, the main opposition BJP, which emerged as the single largest party with 32 seats, declined to form a government.It said it would sit in opposition since it did not have the support of 36 legislators needed to rule Delhi.The AAP had initially taken a similar stand, only to change its mind in saying it had received "overwhelming support" from voters to go ahead and form a government.The AAP - whose party symbol is a broom - was born out of a strong anti-corruption movement that swept India two years ago.
