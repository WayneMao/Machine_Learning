Media playback is not supported on this deviceAndy Murray will aim to maintain his 100% record against Australia's Bernard Tomic when the pair meet in the last 16 of the Australian Open on Monday.The world number two will have to refocus after his father-in-law Nigel Searscollapsed at the tournament.Murray went to hospital after histhird-round win over Joao Sousato visit Sears, who isdue to be released.The Scot, who has beaten 16th seed Tomic in their three previous meetings, plays at 08:00 GMT on Rod Laver Arena.Murray last beat 23-year-old Tomic when the pair met in the Davis Cup in Glasgow last year.However, Tomic will have the support of the home crowd this time and the world number 17 says he has extra motivation after comments made by 17-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer.At the Brisbane International earlier this month, the Swiss said: "Many seasons now in a row we have seen or heard that top 10 is the goal [for Tomic], and he's missed out on it by a long shot."After his third-round win over John Millman on Saturday, Tomic responded by saying Federer was "nowhere near" the level of world number one Novak Djokovic."If he believes I'm very far away from the top 10, I also believe my prediction that he's nowhere near Novak's tennis right now," he said."It also motivates me. When I'm playing well, I'm a top-eight player in the world. My ranking has to get there."I'm going to work every day this year getting to the top 10. It's not just getting to the top 10 - I'm going to get there - it's about staying there for a while. It's about being consistent."Tomic has not reached a Grand Slam quarter-final since Wimbledon in 2011, with a promising career stalling in recent years amid a number of off-court controversies.Most recently, in July last year, he wasarrested in Miami Beachafter a loud party, while in the same month he was dropped from Australia's Davis Cup team followingcriticism of the Australian tennis authorities.Tomic is planning to study Murray's shock fourth-round defeat by Kevin Anderson at last year's US Open, when the South African counter attacked brilliantly."Andy loves playing players that attack. I don't think he likes players like John Isner and Anderson," Tomic said."You have to take the ball to him, play aggressive, but not too aggressive, and rally at the right time."
