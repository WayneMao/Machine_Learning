What you've got is an entirely different recorded music industry, compared to the last time the figures went up annually, because we now have a market which is very heavily digital."In some markets, including the US, more than half of recorded music sales occur digitally, whether it's downloads or streaming."In big parts of the world, there were no revenues coming in at all really.  Now those very important emerging markets like Russia, Brazil, India and China show the industry is at least starting to see some revenues there."Subscription streaming accounts for 10%, while mobile ringtones and ad-funded services like YouTube and Vevo made up the difference.Although the music industry was showing signs of recovery, the IFPI said there were still "major hurdles that need to be addressed to unlock the huge potential for further growth".It said internet piracy still had a seriously impact on the industry, estimating that nearly a third of all internet users regularly access unlicensed sites to download music.The organisation recommended that companies stop advertising on illegal music sites and urged search engine providers to prioritise search results relating to legal services."Our markets remain rigged by illegal free music," said IFPI chief executive Frances Moore."This is a problem where governments have a critical role to play, in particular by requiring more co-operation from advertisers, search engines, ISPs and other intermediaries."These companies' activities have a decisive influence in shaping a legitimate digital music business."
