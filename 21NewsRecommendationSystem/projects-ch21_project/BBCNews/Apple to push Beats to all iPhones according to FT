Apple to push Beats to all iPhones according to FT
Apple is planning to push its Beats music streaming service to every iPhone in the new year, according to a report in the Financial Times newspaper.Apple will include the Beats app in its latest update to the iOS operating system used on iPhones and iPads,writes the FT.Apple purchased Beats, known primarily for its headphones, for $3bn (£1.9bn) earlier this year in May.The company declined to comment on the FT's report.The FT broke the news of Apple's acquisition of Beats earlier in the year.The move into streaming music threatens the dominance of market-leader Spotify, and also comes as downloads from Apple's music store, iTunes, have declined.By pre-installing the app on iPhones and iPads, Apple will be able to easily reach new customers.However, the value of streaming music services to artists has recently come under scrutiny after Taylor Swift pulled her entire music catalogue from Spotify.Ms Swift said that the amount paid to her in royalties from Spotify undervalued her work.Spotify has rejected that claim.
