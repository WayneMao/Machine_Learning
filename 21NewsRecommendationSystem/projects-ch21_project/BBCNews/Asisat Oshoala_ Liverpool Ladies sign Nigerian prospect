"Asisat is one of the best young players in the world."In addition to her star performances in the U20 World Cup, Oshoala also collected the Golden Ball award as the senior Nigeria team qualified for the2015 World Cupby winning the African Women's Championship.And she was named 2014's African Women's Player of the Year and Youth Player of the Year after helping her club side Rivers Angels become Nigerian champions.Beard added: "She's not the finished article yet but she's got pace, power and she certainly knows where the goal is."I watched her at the Under-20 World Cup, where she was sensational, and we had early dialogue with her about coming to Liverpool."There's been plenty of other interest in her in the last few months, but she chose to join us and I'm absolutely delighted."Oshoala, nicknamed 'Seedorf' after Dutch legend Clarence, said: "To be able to join the reigning Super League champions is absolutely fantastic.Media playback is not supported on this device"Liverpool Ladies are a massive club with some fantastic players who I believe can help me to develop my game to the next level."It was also a big incentive to be able to play in the Women's Champions League, which is a huge competition that I'm confident we can do well in."Oshoala is Beard'sfourth signing of the windowafter he also added Satara Murray, Ingrid Ryland and Line Krogedal Smorsgard to his squad.Key players Lucy Bronze and Amanda da Costa have departed, to Manchester City and Washington Spirit respectively.But the manager reckoned: "With the addition of these four new players I believe this is the best squad I've ever put together."We've won the league for the last two years and we'll aim to do it again, although next season is going to be the most competitive ever."Clubs like Manchester City and Notts County have recruited really well and I can see four or five teams battling it out for the title."We can be one of them, especially if we can avoid the dreadful injury problems we had early on last season."
