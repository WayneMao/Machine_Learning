It has set up ahelplinefor anyone else affected by the case.Dr Keith McNeil, its chief executive, said: "Our most abject and sincere apologies go out to any and all of our patients and their families who are affected by this in any way."There is a very ancient and sacred trust that exists between a doctor and his patients, and quite frankly, it sickens me to think that trust has been breached."Chief nurse Ann-Marie Ingle, said: "His cold and calculating abuse of trust has deeply shocked us all, including staff who worked alongside him to care for these vulnerable and sick children."As soon as we were alerted, we took immediate action to suspend him from clinical practice."Cambridgeshire Police said "there are likely to be more victims" and asked affected people to call the hospital's helpline.Det Sgt Shane Fasey, said: "Bradbury's offences were an appalling breach of trust committed against vulnerable victims who had been placed in his care."The families believed the boys were in his safe hands but they were actually being abused by Bradbury, who carried out examinations purely for his own sexual gratification and with no medical justification whatsoever."
