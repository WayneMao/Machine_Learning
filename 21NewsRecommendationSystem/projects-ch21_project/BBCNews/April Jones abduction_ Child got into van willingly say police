This may be because she got in with the driver or that it is left hand drive vehicle."We still believe that the van is grey or light coloured, but again these things can be affected by failing light and street lamps."The indications are that she got into the vehicle willingly... There's nothing to suggest at this stage there was a struggle."Det Supt Bevan added that police were concentrating efforts in the immediate vicinity following specialist advice.He said police had a significant number of pieces of information.This included an initial description of the driver but detectives were not comfortable releasing more details at this stage.When asked about April's family, Det Supt Bevan said "as you would imagine, it must be their worst nightmare so it must be a very difficult time for them".ByCarl YappBBC Wales NewsAt the town's leisure centre, hundreds of people involved in the hunt for April have just set off on another search for her.Following a police briefing, the volunteers are being split into groups of up to 20, one going clockwise, the other anti-clockwise around the town.One volunteer suggested the town's railway line might be closed later, when the search is extended.The leisure centre is bustling with police, council staff, network rail officials, transport police. Members of the public have brought dogs along.More people are joining the search all the time.Lynne Owen, 45, from nearby Llanerfyl, drove to Machynlleth on Tuesday morning."We're off out on another search now," he said. "We've been given a description of her and told not to touch anything if we find something."Back on April's estate, the road is cordoned off and a police van and car are parked nearby, while a lone officer stands beyond the cordon in the rain.Overhead the rumblings of a police helicopter and the Wales Air Ambulance can be heard.A few miles out of town, people in fluorescent jackets are stopping drivers near a mini roundabout in what appears to be an attempt to find out more information.'Not ruling anything out'He said the force were getting help from neighbouring Welsh forces, and some English in relation to the Child Rescue Alert system (CRA).The CRA brings together the forces of police, media and the public to help find abducted children by publishing details as soon as possible.The South Wales Police and Gwent Police helicopters are also helping in the search.April disappeared close to her home on the Bryn Y Gog estate in Machynlleth.Road blocks have been set up as officers and hundreds of local people continue conducting searches of the local area, woodland and isolated farmland.Police helicopters, the fire service and police dog teams have been mobilised.

We're not ruling anything out, we're not ruling anything in."Police have praised the "tremendous response" from the community.Hundreds of people have been gathering at the local leisure centre to help with the search.Alun Hughes, a friend of April's family said: "We were out last night and at the moment we are waiting for the police to organise specialist searches of the town."Search volunteer Anwen Morris said locals had searched an area with a 30-mile radius using quad bikes and off-road vehicles.Mayor of Machynlleth Gareth Jones said people had travelled from outside of the area to help."We live in hope.," he said.
