Andros Townsend: Newcastle complete £12m signing
Newcastle have completed the signing of England winger Andros Townsend from Tottenham for a fee of about £12m.The 24-year-old has signed a five-year deal with the Magpies.Townsend has made just three substitute appearances in the Premier League this season and was dropped for a Europa League match in November aftera row with fitness coach Nathan Gardiner."Newcastle is a fantastic club with great fans, a great stadium and great tradition," he told the club's website."As soon as I heard Newcastle were interested in me, there was only one place I wanted to go so I can't wait to get started."Newcastle United head coach Steve McClaren said: "Bringing Andros to the club is a great signing."Andros is a winger with an old-fashioned style. He can play on the right or the left, is two-footed, quick, very direct and loves taking on defenders and crossing the ball."Townsend joined the Spurs academy aged eight but did not become a first-team regular until the start of the 2013-14 season, by which time he had been sent out on nine separate loan spells.This season, though, he has only started three games - two in the Europa League and the Capital One Cup defeat by Arsenal.He has won 10 England caps, the last of which came as a substitute in the3-0 European Championship qualifying win in Lithuania.Find all the latest football transferson our dedicated page.
