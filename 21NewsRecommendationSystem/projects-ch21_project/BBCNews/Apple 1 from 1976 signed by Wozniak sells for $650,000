About 46 remain in existence, but only six of those are still in working order.Bob Luther, author of The First Apple, called the Apple 1 the "holy grail of collectable technology".The one sold at auction in the German city of Cologne on Saturday was purchased together with an original monitor, tape-player and keyboard. The documentation was signed by Steve Jobs.
