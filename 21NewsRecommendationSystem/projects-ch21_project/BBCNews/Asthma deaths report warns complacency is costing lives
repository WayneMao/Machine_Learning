Asthma deaths report warns complacency is costing lives
People suffering from asthma are dying unnecessarily because of complacency among both medical staff and patients, according to the first national study of asthma deaths in the UK.Researchers found that in nearly half of the cases they looked at, asthma sufferers did not receive any medical help during their final asthma attack.TheNational Review of Asthma Deathssays sufferers and medics must be better at recognising the danger signs.The UK has 5.5 million asthmatics.Although deaths linked to the condition have been falling, there were 1,242 in 2012 - meaning the UK has some of the highest asthma death rates in Europe.Holly Sparshott, from Gosport, died of asthma at the age of 12. Her mother, Sarah, is campaigning to raise awareness about how dangerous the disease can be.The national study involved a detailed examination of the circumstances around 195 such deaths.Among the review's key findings were:Sarah Sparshott, from Gosport, lost her 12-year-old daughter, Holly, to an asthma attack in October 2013.Holly died at a hospice after falling into a coma when she had an attack that stopped her breathing for 15 minutes.Holly was diagnosed with asthma at the age of two. Her asthma got progressively worse as she approached puberty.A month before Holly collapsed, Sarah took her to the doctor and asked for her to see an asthma consultant . "She was refused because she wasn't bad enough," Sarah recalls."It makes me frustrated. I couldn't have done any more than I could as a parent."My campaign now is to make people aware that you can die from asthma. It is serious."Source: Asthma UKResearchers found that clinicians and patients alike had become complacent about the illness.Since asthma symptoms can come and go, some patients may forget or feel they don't need to keep taking their medication, for example.The report calls for better monitoring and improved education for doctors, nurses, patients and carers.Dr Kevin Stewart of the Royal College of Physicians, which managed the review, said: "It's time to end our complacency about asthma, which can, and does, kill.  There are important messages in this report for clinicians, for patients and their families and for policy-makers."We haven't paid enough attention to the importance of good routine asthma care by clinicians with the right training and experience and the part that patients themselves play in this."Too often we have also been slow to detect signs of poor asthma control and slow to act when these have been present, with tragic consequences for some families."Prof Chris Griffiths of Queen Mary University of London was also involved in the report.He said it revealed that care had deteriorated since an analysis in 2005.Prof Griffiths said: "These worrying statistics can and must be turned around in the next decade."Those of us who work in general practice must implement the recommendation to have a named clinician responsible for asthma in each practice."Despite facing huge challenges as we work to meet current NHS organisational change, we need to prioritise asthma care in order to reduce deaths in the UK."Kay Boycott, chief executive of the Asthma UK says the charity "wholeheartedly endorses" the report.She said: "This confidential enquiry has identified prescribing errors of a frankly horrifying scale and is a damning indictment of current routine practice."In many of the cases the experts examined, warning signs were found to have been ignored.Ms Boycott added: "Past attacks are a clear risk factor for future attacks, but more than two-thirds of the people hospitalised in the month before they died did not get properly checked up afterwards."It's heart-breaking that the review has found 46% of deaths could have been avoided with better routine care."Prof Mike Morgan, NHS England's national clinical director for respiratory services, said: "These statistics are a call to action for commissioners, health professionals and patients."Every patient should have a care plan which should be regularly reviewed and patients should be supported to manage their asthma, including effective inhaler technique and knowledge of their condition."The Irish, Scottish and Welsh Governments said they would look closely at the key findings of the report.A spokesman for the Department of Health in Northern Ireland (DHSSPS) said: "As part of its continuing commitment to improve services, the department will consider the findings and recommendations of the National Review of Asthma Deaths and what lessons can be learned from the report."
