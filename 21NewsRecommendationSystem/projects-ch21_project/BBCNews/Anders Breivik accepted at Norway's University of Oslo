Anders Breivik accepted at Norway's University of Oslo
Norwegian mass killer Anders Behring Breivik has won a place to study political science at Oslo's university.The 36 year old admitted killing 77 people when he bombed central Oslo and then went on a shooting spree at a youth camp on a nearby island in 2011.Breivik has been studying certain course modules since first applying to the University of Oslo in 2013, but he will now be taught as a full student.He will have no contact with staff or students as he studies from his cell.In 2012, he was sentenced to the maximum 21 years in prison for carrying out Norway's worst massacre since World War Two.This jail term can be extended if he is deemed to remain a danger to society.The university's rector, Ole Petter Ottersen, said that Norwegian inmates "have a right to pursue higher education in Norway if they meet the admission requirements and are successful in competition with other applicants."Writing on the university's website, Mr Ottersen admitted that the university had faced "moral dilemmas" about Breivik's admission.The rector added that the university had students whose family members had been killed by Breivik. However, he said that the university would abide by its rules "for our own sake, not for his."As he studies from his prison, Breivik will be subject to strict regulations. He will be allowed no access to internet resources or receive any personal guidance from tutors. All communication with the university will take place via "a contact person in prison".Breivik first applied to study in 2013 but did not meet entry requirements as he had never completed secondary school. Instead, he was allowed to study certain political science modules.His deadly rampage at a Labour Party youth camp on Utoeya island was found by anOslo court to have been a premeditated act of terrorism.He harboured extremist right-wing views and claimed he had reacted against what he saw as a Marxist-Islamic takeover of Europe.
