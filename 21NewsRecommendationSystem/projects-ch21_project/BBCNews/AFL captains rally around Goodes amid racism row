AFL captains rally around Goodes amid racism row
The captains of all 18 Australian Rules football clubs have called on fans to stop booing football star Adam Goodes.The embattled Sydney Swans player also received strong support on Friday from a growing number of business leaders, including billionaire James Packer.Goodes, an Indigenous Australian, has been plagued by booing while on the field, which his supporters say is prompted by racism.The footballer is now taking time off from the sport.Some fans have defended the booing, saying it is not racist but simply because they do not like Goodes as a player.The Australian Football League (AFL) Players' Association and team skippersreleased a statement on Fridayexpressing their distaste for the constant booing of Goodes this year, especially during last Sunday's clash at Perth's Subiaco Oval.The statement - being described as an unprecedented show of support for one player - called on fans to celebrate Australia's diversity and keep the game free of prejudice."Enjoy the game, celebrate the success but don't boo, jeer or taunt players because of who they are or what they stand for," it said.About 150 community, political and business groups also issued a statement supporting Goodes and calling for an end to racism in sport, reported Australian Associated Press.The organisations, which include schools, unions and several indigenous advocacy groups, said Goodes should be commended for displaying his culture on the football field and for taking a "courageous stance" against racism.Separately, one of Australia's wealthiest and most influential businessmen, Crown chairman James Packer, said on Friday he was "ashamed" by the whole affair.Speaking in Melbourne at a Crown function in support of indigenous employment programs, Mr Packer said Goodes should be treated with more respect."He's a great Australian. He won Australian of the Year, I think he's an amazing role model," Mr Packer said, local media reported.Prime Minister Tony Abbott also urged fans to treat Goodes with respect."Certainly the last thing we want in Australia is anything, anything at all, that smacks of racism," Mr Abbott told Radio 2SM.
