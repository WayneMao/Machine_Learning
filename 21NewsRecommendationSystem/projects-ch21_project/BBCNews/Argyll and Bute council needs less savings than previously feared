Argyll and Bute council needs less savings than previously feared
Argyll and Bute Council will need to save less money over the next few years than it had expected, the council has said.However, the local authority will still need to find savings of between £21-26m.Options for savings are due to be debated in the coming months and budget decisions will be taken in February.Last week Scotland's largest council, Glasgow, warned it would need to save about £100m.There are several reasons why councils need to save money.As a general rule, their budgets are not keeping up with inflation and the increasing demand for certain services. This means finding savings elsewhere.Raising the council tax - which typically makes up less than a fifth of each council's budget - is not a realistic option. The terms of the Scottish government's council tax freeze mean that any rise would need to be substantial before it could add significantly to the council's budget.The Scottish government gives councils the bulk of their cash. It currently receives all its money from the UK government, which believes cutting the deficit is vital.When councils talk of how much they will need to save in the future, they are looking at longer-term forecasts which, inevitably, can change for the better or worse.Argyll and Bute - which covers several islands and a stretch of the mainland stretching from the Mull of Kintyre to Helensburgh and Loch Lomond - expects to save about £9m next year.The council's leader Dick Walsh said: "Achieving the significant level of savings that we must will impact on our employees and on the work we are able to do for our communities. We are focused clearly therefore on delivering enough savings, but no more than enough.''A lot of work has been done to identify options to explore in making savings. We have identified more potential options than the council will need to take."
