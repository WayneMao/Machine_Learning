Aston Villa sign Christian Benteke and Ashley Westwood
Aston Villa have completed the signings of Genk striker Christian Benteke and Crewe midfielder Ashley Westwood.Both players have signed four-year deals with Belgium international Benteke, 21, believed to have cost £7m, while Westwood, 22, has moved for £2m."I know Darren Bent is a great striker and I want to play with him and work hard for the team," Benteke said.Westwood added: "From the conversations I've had with the boss [Paul Lambert] I think I will fit in perfectly."Westwood, who has made 134 appearances for Crewe, scoring 15 goals, said: "Lambert said to me that he's looking for younger lads to work with him, step up and lift this club to the next level and I'm really looking forward to the challenge."Westwood and Benteke become the seventh and eighth signings for new manager Lambert.The Belgian has made five appearances for his country and scored his first goal against the Netherlands in a recent friendly game. During this calendar year he has scored 18 goals in 29 games in domestic football and in Europe.Villa manager Lambert said: "Christian is only but already he's an established Belgian international and he's had a terrific time at Genk. He's something very different to what we have here and that added dimension will enhance the football club."A young lad he may be, but he's definitely a handful. He's tall, powerful, he has pace and we'll be stronger with him in the side."
