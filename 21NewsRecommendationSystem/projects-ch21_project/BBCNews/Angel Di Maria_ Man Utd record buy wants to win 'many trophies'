Media playback is not supported on this deviceRecord signing Angel Di Maria says he has joined Manchester United to help return them to the Champions League and "win many trophies".The Argentine winger joined United from Real Madrid for aBritish record transfer fee of £59.7mon Tuesday.Di Maria, 26, said he wants to help United become "an important team once again, to win many trophies with them".United coach Louis van Gaal said he hopes for more signings before Monday's transfer deadline.Di Maria could make his debut on Saturday against newly promoted Burnley in the Premier League.He added: "I like the team and I wanted to come here even though they're not playing in the Champions League. I want to help the team get into the Champions League. I'm pleased with the manager for choosing me to come to Manchester United."Di Maria will wear the number seven jersey, previously worn by George Best, Bryan Robson, Eric Cantona, David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo.United have taken just one point from a potential six in the Premier League so far and were knocked out of the Capital One Cup after a4-0 defeat by League One sideMK Dons on Tuesday.Van Gaal told a news conference at Old Trafford: "I hope Di Maria shall give us good results but we cannot expect after two days training that he is the miracle.""We have to look at the future and we're doing that now with Manchester United by restoring and rebuilding a new team and that costs time," he added."Di Maria fits in our philosophy and I can change the system with him and maybe we will do that in the future, maybe in a match. At Real Madrid he didn't only play as a winger but also in midfield so that is also a reason why we are convinced he shall succeed."The Old Trafford club have now spent £131.7m since last season, having bought left-backLuke Shaw,midfielderAnder Herreraand Di Maria's Argentina team-mateMarcos Rojofor a combined £72m this summer.Speaking about the transfer deadline, Van Gaal added: "The club will announce when the time's there.
