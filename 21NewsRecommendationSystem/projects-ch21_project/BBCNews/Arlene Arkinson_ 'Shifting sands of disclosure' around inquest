Arlene Arkinson: 'Shifting sands of disclosure' around inquest
A coroner has expressed frustration at "the constantly shifting sands of disclosure" in the case of Castlederg teenagerArlene Arkinson.The 15-year-old County Tyrone girl vanished after a night out at a disco in County Donegal in August 1994.  Her body has never been found.On Friday,  the only suspect in the case,Robert Howard, 71 died.At a preliminary hearing, the coroner directed files be made available to the Arkinson family next week.In eight years since the preliminary inquest process began, a number of fixed hearing dates have been scrapped due to delays in disclosing papers.The process of security vetting dozens of case files before disclosure has been further complicated as the Police Service of Northern Ireland has applied for Public Interest Immunity (PII) on three of the files, in a bid to stop their contents being outlined in court.At the hearing at Belfast's coroner's court, Coroner Brian Sherrard warned that PII takes the case outside his remit and into ministerial hands.A barrister for the family pointed out that there have been 30 previous preliminary hearings.Criticising the allocation of police resources to preparing files, he told the court: "I have said before that this case was being prepared on the never never. It is being prepared on a part-time basis."A lawyer for the PSNI said that while one officer - the officer in charge of the case - is out of the country at the moment, others have been working on it."This is an ongoing, very detailed and comprehensive process for the police," he said.Mr Sherrard asked if there was a mechanism by which the court could alert the Secretary of State, Theresa Villiers, to the urgency of the case, given that a date of 1 February, 2016 has been set for the inquest."I'm sure she will understand there is an expectation that we will proceed on February 1," the coroner said.He stressed that the set deadline would be met. "We need to have this in a very, very timely fashion if we are going to keep to a February date and we are going to keep to a February date," he said."It is not in anyone's interests, particularly the family or the public's interests, to have any further delays."
