"Ander's decision doesn't match that, which is disappointing."It's not a pleasant moment, but it doesn't alter our philosophy nor our way of working."Bilbao-born Herrera remains thankful to his home-town club.£37.1m:Juan Mata (from Chelsea) 2014£30.75m:Dimitar Berbatov (Tottenham) 2008£29.1m:Rio Ferdinand (Leeds) 2002£29m:Ander Herrera (Athletic Bilbao) 2014£28.1m:Juan Sebastian Veron (Lazio) 2001£27.5m:Marouane Fellaini (Everton) 2013£27m:Wayne Rooney (Everton) 2004All fees approximate"I will never forget my time with Athletic Club," he said.
