Lord's was also very tough - the way we lost there in conditions that were suited to us."But I'm quite stubborn - I believe in my ability. I stuck in there through the tough times. Sport tests your character and to bounce back as a team is testament to our character."Defeat at Lord's extended England's winless run to 10 Tests and prompted widespread calls for an out-of-form Cook to stand down.Media playback is not supported on this deviceBut the left-handed opening batsman bounced back with three fifties in four innings as Englandbeat India at Southamptonbefore completing a remarkable comeback with victories inside three daysat Old Traffordand The Oval."I remember saying when we were 1-0 down that I still thought we were going to win the series," said Cook."I had a lot of confidence in the talent and skill we had in the dressing room but I didn't think we'd win quite as emphatically as we have done."English cricket needed a series win and to deliver like we have delivered puts a big smile on our face."The bowlers all took wickets and almost all the batters scored runs, so it's almost the perfect game."We haven't felt like this for a long time. We were laughing out there. You don't get many days like that."We have to enjoy it and hope it's the start of a long road back."England seamer James Anderson was named man of the series after taking 25 wickets.He said he was motivated to do well by India's decision to report him to the International Cricket Council (ICC) for allegedly pushing and abusing Ravindra Jadeja during the first Test at Trent Bridge.Anderson was eventuallycleared of misconduct by an ICC tribunal."At Southampton, when stuff was going on before and after the game, the fact that we made such a conscious effort to concentrate on the cricket not only helped me but also the rest of the team," he added."Since then, we've not let India back in the series, which is credit to everyone who has played."Listen to Jonathan Agnew and Geoffrey Boycott review each day's play onthe TMS podcast.
