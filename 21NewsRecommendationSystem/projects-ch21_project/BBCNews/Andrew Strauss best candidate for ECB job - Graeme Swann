Andrew Strauss best candidate for ECB job - Graeme Swann
Andrew Strauss is the perfect candidate to become the England and Wales Cricket Board's director of cricket, says former England spinner Graeme Swann.Former captainStrauss is set to take on the new role,created following the exit of managing director Paul Downton."Strauss is a fantastic leader of men, he knows cricket inside out and is a born diplomat and politician," Swann told BBC Sport."I can't think of anyone better for the role, whatever it is."The remit of the post is unclear as the ECB has declined to make the job description public.Downton left his post following England's dismal World Cup and, in the aftermath of the disappointing 1-1 Test series draw with West Indies, former England batsman Geoffrey Boycott said "things won't change" if Strauss is named director of cricket.However Swann, who played 42 of his 60 Tests under Strauss, countered: "Without seeing the job description, we've no idea the influence he will be able to have.Media playback is not supported on this device"But in my experience he is a great man to have in charge."When asked about the possibility of working under Strauss, England coach Peter Moores said: "He has a very strong reputation. The experience he could bring would be fantastic."Moores also addressed some of the criticism his team have faced in the aftermath of their draw in the Caribbean, which was confirmed with a five-wicket defeat in the third Test in Barbados.Jonathan Trott, who on Monday announcedhis retirement from international cricket,managed only 72 runs in six innings, including three ducks, after being asked to open the batting on his return to the side."We don't regret asking him to open," said Moores of 34-year-old Trott, who batted at number three for the rest of his Test career. "It was a question we had to answer."It was right to give him the chance. He's had a go, but it has been a tough trip for him so he will be disappointed."England also endured criticism for failing to select Yorkshire leg-spinner Adil Rashid in any of the three Tests, especially after Moeen Ali struggled in the decisive loss in Barbados."Mo had a tough game, but he has come through a brilliant last year," said Moores. "He is young in terms of his career as a bowler and he was challenged in Barbados."I hope Adil Rashid had a good trip. He has worked very hard to adapt to what he thinks will be successful at Test-match level."He's a very talented batsman as well as bowler and we are hoping that development will continue."
