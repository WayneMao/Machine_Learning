A national commemoration of the centenary of the Battle of the Somme is to be held in Manchester this summer, the government has announced.The Somme was one of the bloodiest battles of World War One with more than one million casualties over 141 days.Tickets have been released for the free 1 July concert at Heaton Park - which was used as a training ground for Somme-bound army recruits.Manchester will also host a remembrance service, parade and heritage event.Culture Secretary John Whittingdale said: "The Battle of the Somme resulted in one million casualties on the Western Front and touched the lives of millions of families at home."We must never forget what happened at the Somme. I hope that people across the country take part in the range of events in Manchester to honour the memories of those who gave so much."Manchester's commemorations include:Manchester City Council's deputy leader Sue Murphy said:"Northern England was the heartland of the Pals' battalions throughout the First World War and was also at the centre of the huge industrial effort for the Somme."It is therefore fitting that the focal point of remembrance and opportunities for people to learn about and reflect further on the enormity of the events at the Somme should be in our city."
