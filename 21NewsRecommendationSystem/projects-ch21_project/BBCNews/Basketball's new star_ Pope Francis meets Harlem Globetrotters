Basketball's new star: Pope Francis meets Harlem Globetrotters
The Harlem Globetrotters have a new star: none other than Pope Francis himself.The basketball team arrived in the Vatican on Wednesday as part of a tour of Italy.The Pope was presented with a framed Globetrotters shirt adorned with the name Pope Francis, and the number 90 on the back.He also took time out from his weekly general audience to be taught a few basketball skills.The Globetrotters, a basketball exhibition team, were founded in 1926, and were one of the first to feature African-American players at a time of segregation in the United States.While visiting Pope Francis, they did not, however, go as far as they did when they were last at the Vatican -when they made Pope John Paul II an honorary member of the team.The significance of the number 90 on Pope Francis' honorary shirt was not immediately clear - althoughhis most recent approval rating among US Catholics was at 90%.
