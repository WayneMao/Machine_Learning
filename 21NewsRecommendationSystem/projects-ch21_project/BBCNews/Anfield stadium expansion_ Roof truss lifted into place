Anfield stadium expansion: Roof truss lifted into place
A 650-tonne roof truss has been lifted on to Anfield's Main Stand as part of work to expand Liverpool's home ground.The structure was fixed on to towers by two of the UK's largest cranes and took eight hours to be put in place.Liverpool, whichbegan work on the stadium expansion last year,said it marked another "incredible chapter".Work is under way to increase Anfield's capacity from about 45,500 to 59,000. The Main Stand will feature a new third tier, adding 8,300 seats.The Anfield Road Stand will then be expanded to add a further 4,800 seats.The £100m work is expected to be completed in time for the 2016-17 season.Ian Ayre, the club's chief executive, said: "This is an historic milestone in Anfield's history as the stadium transformation continues to take shape."This is a redevelopment that gives us a fantastic opportunity to ensure that all the rich history and traditions that make this stadium so special can continue for many years to come."Source:Liverpool FC
