Australia v New Zealand: David Warner hits 163 as hosts dominate
David Warner hit a brilliant 163 as Australia amassed 389-2 on the opening day of the Test series against New Zealand in Brisbane.Usman Khawaja made an unbeaten 102 - his maiden Test century - while Joe Burns weighed in with 71 and captain Steve Smith 41 not out at the Gabba.Opener Warner struck 19 fours and a six in his 224-ball innings, sharing an opening stand of 161 with Burns.The match is the first in a three-Test series.Warnerdescribed Brendon McCullum as "immature"before the Test, after the New Zealand captain criticised the Australia batsman and Smith.Never before have Australia scored so many runs on the first day of a Test at the Gabba, beating the 364-2 they made against England in 2002.They raced along at almost 4.5 an over after winning the toss as an ineffective New Zealand attack conceded 51 boundaries.Warner batted with great composure either side of Burns' dismissal, caught behind off Tim Southee in the 39th over.Although Warner fell in the final session to a superb diving catch by Ross Taylor at first slip, Khawaja - playing his first Test since 2013 - was well on the way to a 123-ball century.Smith also scored freely as he and Khawaja added an unbroken 78 for the third wicket to cap a sensational day for the hosts.Listen to ball-by-ball commentary of every day of the Test series onBBC Radio 5 live sports extra.Play starts at 00:00 GMT.
