Australian Bayliss winning Ashes for England 'beautiful' - Broad
Stuart Broad says he is relishing the prospect of an Australian guiding England to Ashes glory.Trevor Baylissis thefirst Australianto coach England and his maiden series in charge will be the Ashes, which start in Cardiff on 8 July."I love the fact he's Australian, and could potentially take the Ashes away from Australia," Broad said."To see a picture of an Aussie with the Three Lions on his chest, Ashes urn in his hand, that would be beautiful."He added: "I quite like that sort of banter involved in the series."However, Broad also said he did not want this summer's series to descend into the acrimony associated with recent Ashes encounters.Two years ago in England, Broad elected tostand his grounddespite a seemingly clear edge to slip, and later that summer Australia coach Darren Lehmann gave aradio interviewin which he urged Australian fans to make the England bowler cry in the return series down under, calling him a "blatant cheat".Broad was tauntedduring the first Test of the 2013-14 series in Australia, won by thehome side 5-0,which became better known for Australia captain Michael Clarke threatening England bowler James Anderson.Clarkewas fined 20%of his match fee for using an obscenity while warning Anderson to expect a broken arm, after his comments were picked up by a stump microphone.In addition, Australia opener David Warner, who hadpunched Joe Rootin the face in a bar during the 2013 series in England, called Jonathan Trott"poor and weak"in Australia and Trott laterleft that tourbecause of a stress-related condition."Michael Clarke telling Jimmy to 'get ready for a broken arm' - that has been in Australian cricket for years and it is not going to change now, but we have to play to our advantages and style," Broad said.Buoyed by a one-day internationalseries victoryover World Cup finalists New Zealand, England have travelled to Spain for afour-day tripwith new coach Bayliss."You have seen in the past couple of months guys playing with smiles on their faces and playing aggressive, free-flowing, positive cricket, and that is how we will beat Australia," Broad said. "We won't beat them by out-sledging them."
