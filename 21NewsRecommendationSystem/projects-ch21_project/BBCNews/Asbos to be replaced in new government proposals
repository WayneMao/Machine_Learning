Asbos to be replaced in new government proposals
The government has announced new plans to tackle anti-social behaviour in England and Wales, including orders to replace Asbos.Proposals in the government's White Paperinclude cutting the number of different orders from 19 to six.A "community trigger" would also force police, councils and agencies to act if five households made a complaint.Labour said the new measures were a "weaker rebrand" of powers to tackle anti-social behaviour.The government says it wants to take the existing 19 powers and reduce them to six which are connected to the behaviour of people, the protection of places and the powers of the police.Under the new proposals:The trigger that they're talking about - five people causes trigger - is it five people on the same street? Five people in the community? Have four people got to suffer unless they can get a fifth person to come forward?The bottom line with Asbos - and any minor problems with them - is that the people that are getting them, the victims, they don't have enough support.And everything that comes out of the Home Office since I started in to them 10 years ago, there is never funding to support the victims and witnesses to anti-social behaviour.People may report anti-social behaviour to the police, but they might not follow it through with a statement in writing and that is the problem. And that is going to be the problem with this.They've still got to get people to come forward and report. I couldn't get five people on my street to report anything - regardless of what I've done over the years here.They might report it, but they won't follow it through and that's the problem, it's the fear factor.Source:  BBC Radio 5LiveHome Secretary Theresa May told the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) annual conference in Manchester that the government's approach "empowers local communities, places victims' needs at its heart and puts more trust in the professionals than ever before".Mrs May said the community trigger would be piloted in three areas - Manchester, Brighton and Hove and West Lindsey, in Lincolnshire, from 1 June. It will force the police, councils and other agencies to act if five households complain, or the same individual complains three times.And she told Acpo the new approach "will not dump all of society's problems on the police"."We are challenging local agencies to do more to prevent crime and anti-social behaviour in the first place - lowering the burden on the police - and our new powers are available to range of agencies and explicitly include actions to change an offender's behaviour and stop future incidents."Mrs May earlier told the BBC that Asbos were "too bureaucratic" and took too long to put into place.The Home Office first signalled an end to Asbos, introduced under Tony Blair's Labour government, earlier at the start of last year.It believes the orders are seen by some youths as a badge of honour and it has pointed out that more than half are breached at least once.The shadow home office minister, Gloria De Piero, says while Asbos are imperfect, the new measures will only make matters worse."Asbos are sometimes breached and that's a really serious thing. That's why you get a criminal record."Actually half of the people who breach Asbos end up behind bars, that's how seriously Labour took it. The new Crime Prevention Injunction, you won't even get a criminal record."One woman from Backworth in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, who has been a repeated victim of anti-social behaviour, told the BBC she supported the move to lower the burden of proof for anti-social acts."You have to have a level of trust in the community, that people like me do not make things up."But the main problem is that there is not enough of a multi-agency approach to the problem."In my experience the police are proactive in trying to identify and find those who threaten us but the local authority is not."There needs to be more intelligence shared between the agencies."Javed Khan, chief executive of Victim Support, said victims of anti-social behaviour should be taken seriously as soon as they made a report to the police.He added: "We hope that the new Criminal Behaviour Order will deliver the rapid response for victims that is needed."But just dishing out the orders won't be enough. If the government really wants to put victims first, tough enforcement and follow-up will be required, to avoid making the CBO an empty sanction."
