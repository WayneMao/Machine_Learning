Aston Martin recalls 17,000 cars over possible defective part
Aston Martin is recalling more than 17,000 cars because of a potentially defective part.The Warwickshire-based luxury car maker said the recall accounted for most of its sports cars built since late 2007.It follows the discovery that a Chinese sub-supplier was allegedly using counterfeit plastic material in part of the accelerator pedal.There are fears the pedal arm may break although there have been no reports of any accidents, the firm said.A spokesman said it would now bring manufacture of the pedal arm back to the UK.The firm is recalling a total of 17,590 cars - 1,553 in the UK - including all of its left-hand-drive models built since November 2007 and all right-hand-drive models built since May 2012, affecting about 75% of all cars built in those periods.The recall applies to all cars apart from the new Vanquish coupe and Volante models."Customer safety is very important and to change the pedal takes less than an hour, so take the car and get it replaced is what we're saying," the spokesman said."It's very important to say that there have not been any incidents or accidents."
