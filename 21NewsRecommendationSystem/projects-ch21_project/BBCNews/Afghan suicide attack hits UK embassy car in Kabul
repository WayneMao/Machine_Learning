Afghan suicide attack hits UK embassy car in Kabul
A suicide bomber has hit a UK embassy vehicle in the Afghan capital Kabul, with a British worker and an Afghan member of staff among those killed.The Briton who died was a member of the embassy security team, as was another UK national who was wounded.Three other Afghans were killed and more than 30 wounded in the attack, which the Taliban say they carried out.Hours later, Taliban fighters staged an attack in the wealthy Kabul neighbourhood of Wazir Akbar Khan.Witnesses described hearing several explosions and a gun battle before the area was secured by police.Bodyguards belonging to Vice-President Abdul Rashid Dostum reportedly fought with the attackers.Several embassies, foreign compounds and international agencies are located in the district.It is not clear what the target of the second attack was.The Taliban has been targeting foreigners in recent attacks.UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond condemned the attack on the UK vehicle as "appalling".The blast occurred on a busy road and was heard across eastern parts of the city.The British embassy four-wheel-drive was thrown on to its side when the suicide car bomber struck. Many other vehicles were destroyed.Earlier Afghan officials said the bomber had been riding a motorcycle.Mr Hammond said: "I am deeply saddened to confirm that a British national civilian security team member and an Afghan national working for the embassy were killed in the incident. A second British member of the security team was injured."I condemn this appalling attack on innocent civilians supporting our diplomatic activity."The attack comes three days after two US soldiers were killed in a bomb attack on Nato forces, also in eastern Kabul.President Ashraf Ghani, who came to power in September, has vowed to bring peace to the country after decades of conflict.But the Taliban have stepped up attacks as most foreign combat troops prepare to leave Afghanistan next month.About 12,000 Nato soldiers are expected to remain to train and advise Afghan security forces from 1 January.A separate US-led force will assist Afghan troops in some operations against the Taliban. The security pacts with Nato and the US are yet to be ratified by the Afghan upper house.
