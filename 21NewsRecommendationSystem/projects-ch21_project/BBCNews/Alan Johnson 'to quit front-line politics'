He is proving to be a formidable leader of the Labour Party and has shown me nothing but support and kindness."My time in Parliament will now be dedicated to serving my constituents and supporting the Labour Party. I will make no further comment about this matter."Mr Johnson declined to comment as he left a Labour Party meeting in his constituency.BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the resignation had "come out of the blue" and it was not one of those stories that people had been gossiping about and wondering if it would become public.However, he said Westminster was now "abuzz with rumours about his marriage" and stressed Mr Johnson had not been "pushed out" because of his handling of the shadow chancellorship."This is a deeply uncomfortable personal story which I fear Alan Johnson may see spread out in newspapers and will have to tackle in public as well as in private," he added.Mr Miliband told the BBC he had accepted the resignation "with great regret", adding: "As shadow chancellor and a politician who held five cabinet positions, Alan showed real leadership on issues that mattered to families across our country, warning of the dangers posed by the government's gamble on growth and jobs, promoting educational opportunity and delivering neighbourhood policing."Ed Balls is an outstanding economist and is hugely qualified to take our economic message to the country."In a BBC interview, he said: "Alan Johnson was the right man for the job. He's had to stand down for personal reasons, nothing to do with the job."Mr Balls, who ran against Mr Miliband in last year's Labour leadership contest, coming third, said: "It is a great honour to be appointed to this post, and to succeed my friend and colleague Alan Johnson whose commitment to social justice and service to the Labour Party is second to none."As Mr Miliband reshuffles his frontbench team, Douglas Alexander becomes shadow foreign secretary and Liam Byrne is made shadow work and pensions secretary.Tessa Jowell becomes shadow Cabinet Office minister.Sixty-year-old Mr Johnson, an MP since 1997, served as home secretary, health secretary and education secretary under Gordon Brown.Conservative deputy chairman Michael Fallon said: "Alan Johnson is a good man and I wish him well. But what really beggars belief is the appointment of Ed Balls..."He was Gordon Brown's first lieutenant... [They] brought the government to the brink of bankruptcy."
