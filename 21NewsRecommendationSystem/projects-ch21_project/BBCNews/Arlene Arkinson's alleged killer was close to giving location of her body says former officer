Arlene Arkinson's alleged killer was close to giving location of her body says former officer
A senior police officer who investigated the disappearance of the Castlederg teenager Arlene Arkinson has said he believes her alleged killer Robert Howard was close to telling him where her body was located.Arlene Arkinson was last seen with Robert Howard, whodied in prisonearlier this month, after attending a disco in County Donegal in August 1994.Howard was charged eight years after she went missing, but wasacquitted of the teenager's murder in 2005.The jury was not told that Howard had a history of sexual violence and by then he was already serving a life term for killing and raping Hannah Williams from London, whose body was found in 2002.Former Det Ch Supt Norman Baxter met Howard when he was flown from prison in England to be formally charged with the murder of Arlene Arkinson.He told BBC NI's Spotlight programme that he had no doubt that Howard had murdered the teenager."After he was charged he was lodged in the cell block in Enniskillen police station and I received a communication that he had indicated he wanted to speak to the senior investigating officer, so I went to the cell block and I spoke to Robert Howard in the cell," he said."He was extremely agitated, very unsettled, and his main concern was that he wanted to serve his remand period in Maghaberry Prison."He felt that his period there would be much easier because he would have had a single room with an ensuite bathroom and television, whereas in Wormwood Scrubs where he had been brought to Northern Ireland from, he had to slop out and share a cell and felt quite under threat."A hypothetical conversation ensued initiated by Robert Howard indicating the possibility of the body of Arlene Arkinson being recovered."He didn't say it outright, but the implication of the conversation was that he could help us further and I was certain at that stage he was on the cusp of telling where the body was."In my mind I had absolutely no doubt at that point that he was guilty of her murder and knew where her body was."Arlene, a schoolgirl from Castlederg, was last seen alive in a car driven by Howard.She has been missing, presumed dead, for 21 years. Anumber of searches have been carried out at various locations, but her body has never been found.Howard was an inmate at HMP Frankland in County Durham but died in hospital.It is believed he died from natural causes.
