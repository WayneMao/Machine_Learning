Aston Villa are in crisis says new chairman Steve Hollis
Aston Villa are in their worst "crisis" for decades, according to the club's new chairman Steven Hollis.The club are bottom of the top Premier League and 10 points from safety."In football terms, this is a crisis," Hollis told BBC Sport's Pat Murphy. "This is the worst position this club has been in for many a decade."Hollis said the "chequebook hasn't been locked away" should boss Remi Garde want to sign players and also defended club owner Randy Lerner.United States-based Lerner, who bought Villa in 2006, announced at the end of last season he waslooking to sell the club."Randy has actually put more than £200m in player signings, new money, coming into this over the last 10 years," said Hollis.However, he said "spending big cheques" was not going to help ease the club's predicament and instead believes stability is the key."Five different managers in five seasons," he said."How can new players coming in or existing players hired by the previous manager know what the game plan is?"Villa are bottom of the table after collecting just two wins and 12 points from 22 games and look destined for relegation to the Championship.Garde was appointed at the start of November following the sacking of Tim Sherwood, who guided Villa to the FA Cup final last season.
