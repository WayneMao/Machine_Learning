Alexander Litvinenko death inquiry report completed
The inquiry report into the death of ex-Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006 has been completed.Inquiry chairman Sir Robert Owen's report will be published in Parliament on 21 January 2016 and will be sent to the home secretary 48 hours prior.The report will be published on the inquiry's website and Sir Robert will make a brief public statement.Mr Litvinenko, 43, died three weeks after drinking tea laced with the radioactive substance polonium-210.The police investigation concluded the fatal dose of polonium-210 was probably consumed by Mr Litvinenko when he was in the company of former Russian colleagues Andrei Lugovoy and Dmitri Kovtun at London's Millennium Hotel.UK prosecutors want both men to be put on trial for the murder of Mr Litvinenko but it has not been possible to secure their extradition. Both men deny they were involved in murder.The inquiry was set up in July 2014 to establish the facts surrounding the death of Mr Litvinenko, a fierce critic of the Kremlin, including the possible involvement of Russian state agencies.Who was Alexander Litvinenko?
